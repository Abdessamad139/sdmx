1. Increment the version number in setup.py:
   - See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#pre-releases
   - Use '.dev0', '.dev1', etc. suffixes for test releases.

2. Build the source and binary packages:

    $ python setup.py bdist_wheel sdist

3. Check the built packages for correctness. Address any warnings or errors:

    $ twine check dist/*

4. Upload the packages to the TEST instance of PyPI:

    $ twine upload -r testpypi dist/*

5. Check at https://test.pypi.org/project/pandaSDMX/ that:

   - The package can be downloaded, installed and run.
   - The README is rendered correctly.
   - Links to the documentation go to the correct version.

   If not, modify; increment the '.devN' version number suffix, and upload
   again.

6. Change the version number in setup.py.

   - If releasing e.g. '1.2' remove all suffixes like '1.2b3' or '1.2b3.dev4'.
   - If releasing e.g. '1.2b3', remove a development release suffix like
     '1.2b3.dev4'.

7. Commit. This commit should contain only one line change—the version number
   in setup.py—and have the commit message “Release X.Y”.

8. Tag the commit, e.g.:

    $ git tag 1.2

9. Push the commit and tag to Github.

10. Build the source and binary packages. Be sure to first remove any
    development builds:

    $ rm dist/*
    $ python setup.py bdist_wheel sdist

11. Upload to PyPI:

    $ twine upload dist/*
