Overview
----------------------------------

pandaSDMX supports a number of data providers out of the box. Each data provider
is configured by an item in ``agencies.json`` in the package root. Data providers are
identified by an uppercased string such as "ECB" or "OECD". For each pre-configured data provider, ``agencies.json`` contains
the URL and name of the SDMX API and potentially some additional
metadata about the provider's API.

Other data providers can be configured by passing a suitable json-file to the
:meth:`pandasdmx.api.Request.add_agency`.
