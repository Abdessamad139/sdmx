Q: Can SDMX providers other than ECB and Eurostat be supported?

A:
Any SDMX provider can be supported that generates SDMX 2.1-compliant 
messages. The only agencies I know of that deliver data in this format 
are ECB and Eurostat.
Support for SDMX 2.0 messages could be added as a new reader module. Perhaps the model would have to be tweaked a bit as well.
