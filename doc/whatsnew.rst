What's new?
==============

v0.2.1
--------------

* Request.get: allow `fromfile` to be a file-like object
* extract SDMX messages from zip file if given. Important for large datasets from Eurostat
 

v0.2 (2015-04-13)
-----------------------

This version is a quantum leap. The whole project has been redesigned and rewritten from
scratch to provide robust support for many SDMX features. The new architecture is centered around
a pythonic representation of the SDMX information model. It is extensible through readers and writers
for alternative input and output formats. 
Export to pandas has been dramatically improved. Sphinx documentation
has been added.
